COOLVETIQUOTES QUICK START GUIDE
--------------------------------

1. Intstall and activate the theme. First of all you need to download CoolvetiQuotes, un-compress 
it and upload all the content to your theme folder (usually located on /wp-content/themes/). Now 
you can activate CoolvetiQuotes from the Apperance › Themes panel.

2. Create the background categories. Go to Posts › Categories panel and create the following 13 
categories: Azure, Blue, Brown, Carbon, Fluo, Grapewine, Green, Olive, Orange, Purple, Red, Rose, 
Yellow. As you can guess, these categories are needed to assign a custom background color to each 
quote (see pt. 3).

3. Publish your first quote. Just create a new post and write your quote in the title field and 
the author in the main content block. Select from the Category list the color you wish for the 
background. That’s all.
